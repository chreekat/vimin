Some vim support for IN files
=============================

**What's an IN file?**

Eh, it's just a file with an outline. Outlines look like:

    - This item is at the top
    - Here's another item
        - Items nest and stuff

**What's this plugin do?**

It makes outlines fold hecka nice! The above list, at foldlevel=1, would look like:

    - This item is at the top
    + Here's another item (â†“1)

It also makes folded lines bold. That might look funky with some colorschemes, so YMMV.
